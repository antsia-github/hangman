# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. It is split into 5 milestones. 
The final milestone (milestone_5.py) is the ultimate script to play the game.
